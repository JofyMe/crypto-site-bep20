              from, or alter any term of these terms, or to award punitive

              maintain the status quo awaiting arbitration. A request for
              interim measures will not be construed as a renunciation of any of
              the Arbitration Agreement's other rights or responsibilities.

              these Terms is found to be illegal or unenforceable for any
              reason, the other sections of these Terms will remain in effect,
              and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be considered
              changed to the fullest extent permissible by law. You may not
              assign, subcontract, delegate, or otherwise transfer these Terms
              or your rights and responsibilities hereunder without BEP-20's
              prior written agreement, and any attempted assignment,
              subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of the above
              will be null and invalid. BEP-20 is free to assign these Terms as
              he sees fit. Assignees are bound by the terms and conditions set
              forth in these Terms.
