              What is <span> DeFi Governance's</span> Purpose in the
              Cryptocurrency Industry?
            </h1>
            <p class="defi__desc">
              Platforms that combine peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, algorithmic
              automation, and community incentive systems with decentralized
              finance (DeFi) have seen enormous growth in 2020, bringing the
              industry to the forefront of blockchain and financial technology
              (FinTech). Via the use of tokenized governance systems, DeFi aims
              to create more fair and decentralized organizations and industries
              than are now possible through traditional peer-to-peer trade or
              the blockchain nodal structure. Reiterating the blockchain
              community's persistent commitment to decentralization by giving
              users access to governance tokens. By using these governance
              tokens, the worldwide and decentralized community of stakeholders
              who utilize the platform and participate in the broader DeFi
              ecosystem may take over administration of the platform from the
              project's small group of founders, employees, and insiders. In
              order to make important choices concerning protocol updates,
              recruiting engineers, and even altering governance frameworks for
              DeFi initiatives, the project relies on governance procedures. For
              example, the governance process of a borrowing and lending
              platform may be used to decide the amount of collateral necessary
              to borrow money or to alter its interest rate model. Like a
              central exchange, a decentralized exchange (DEX) may modify the
              way its liquidity pools are handled by using its governance
              system. Another option is to leverage the governance process of a
              yield farming platform to employ a third-party code auditor.

              <h4 class="defi__subtitile">Governance Models for Blockchain</h4>
              <p class="defi__desc">
                Off-chain processes like as conferences, mailing lists, online
                forums, and other modes of coordination and decision-making were
                first used to establish the foundations of blockchain
                governance. Some stakeholders are more powerful than others in
                off-chain systems, though. Bitcoin core developers and miners,
                for example, have the greatest sway in the Bitcoin ecosystem
                since more casual users do not have the official methods of
                registering their participation. An on-chain governance system
                that allows stakeholders to vote directly on protocol updates
                was created to give individual users greater power in the
                governance process. If a proposal receives the necessary number
                of votes, it is implemented in a smart contract and becomes a
                reality. The majority of DeFi solutions rely on on-chain
                governance. In order to cast a vote or propose a proposal, you
                usually need to have some kind of "governance token". There is
                some evidence to support the claim that on-chain governance is
                plutocratic due to the fact that the number of tokens a user
                owns frequently affects the weight of their vote.

              <h4 class="defi__subtitile">Tokens of Governance</h4>
              <p class="defi__desc">
                If you want to vote or propose, you'll need to stake your
                governance tokens, which normally use the ERC-20 token standard
                and are commonly kept as collateral for that purpose. Initially,
                governance tokens cannot be acquired, however they may trade on
                exchanges following distribution as a reward for adopting the
                system. As a result, DeFi platform governance tokens have often
                been the subject of conjecture and speculation. A good protocol
                should thus make governance tokens more valuable since they
                provide protocol users greater influence over the allocation of
                resources and the ability to change incentives and capital
                flows.

              <h4 class="defi__subtitile">Processes of DeFi Governance</h4>
              <p class="defi__desc">
                A platform's governance can only commence after tokens have been
                issued. DeFi governance structures that are most often used all
                follow the same basic procedure: In the early stages of DeFi
                governance, stakeholders gather information about the
                community's views on particular concerns and possible
                adjustments. A platform's official governance forum and
                unofficial communication channels both host discussions.
                Ideally, discussion should focus on ideas and policy, however
                politicking is common as individuals strive to persuade others
                in the community to endorse their ideas or recommendations. In
                an effort to bring forth new modifications to the system in a
                systematic and transparent manner, improvement proposals use a
                generic template consisting of the proposal's context and
                description as well as the code that may be changed. For the
                time being, developers are the ones who are submitting the bulk
                of the upgrade ideas. It is possible to debate and examine a
                suggested code modification in the community, and then modify it
                if required. In order to have a valid vote, there must be a
                majority of those present, called a quorum. When a proposal has
                100% support from voters, but the number of token holders who
                vote does not match the minimum percentage necessary, the vote
                is typically canceled. Low involvement in DeFi governance is a
                major issue. As a result, they may not be interested in
                participating in governance since it is time-consuming, less
                immediately rewarding, and/or they lack a strong opinion on the
                proposed modification to the protocol. In this case, they may
                not be interested in participating. For the majority of DeFi
                protocols, a simple majority of more than 50% is sufficient to
                implement a new proposal on the blockchain. When an entity has a
                larger number of tokens, their vote has greater sway. Token
                holders may assign their voting authority to another address if
                they do not want to vote themselves. Once a vote has been taken,
                the idea may be put into practice. Changing the code is the last
                phase in the decentralized governance process since
                recommendations are generally software modifications.

                What Is Yield Farming? Examples of Compounds
              </h4>
              <p class="defi__desc">
                As the first DeFi system to include a governance token, Compound
                set the standard for others to follow. A "yield farming"
                technique that aims to increase DeFi platform incentive
                structures was sparked by the launching of the COMP token in
                June 2020. People that contribute crypto assets to DeFi
                protocols in exchange for governance tokens are known as "yield
                farmers." DeFi dApps may then use these governance tokens to
                earn interest or get access to a variety of digital assets and
                financial instruments when they are deposited. Other DeFi
                systems followed Compound's example because of the efficiency of
                yield farming in bringing in fresh money and the skyrocketing
                value of governance tokens. Platforms and solutions developed by
                DeFi are at the forefront of blockchain governance, proving that
                decentralization need not be sacrificed for efficiency. For now,
                however, DeFi governance tokens and fair launches imply that its
                main procedures will likely have a long-term influence on the
                blockchain industry.
