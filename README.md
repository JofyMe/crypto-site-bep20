# CRYPTO SITE TYPE: BEP-20

Student mockup of a crypto site on the subject of bep20

[LIVE DEMO](https://jofyme.github.io/crypto-site-bep20/)

## WARNING! 

<strong> Corrections and fixes for the future in this project: </strong>

- Made a new builder that will work fine with new projects
- No pixel perfect approach. 
- No clear components that can be adequately reused 
- Font styles would be put in a separate file with fonts when adapting 
- Didn't understand everywhere where to use png, where to use svg, and whether any of these should be used at all
- No clear approach to fonts 
- Not quite sure if I need my own variable for all indents 
- Didn't work with shadows in absolute position in the project, they are there in the design project itself
- Would change the approach to variables, namely colors!
